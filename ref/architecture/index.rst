Platform Architecture
=====================

The Hasura platform is a set of kubernetes resources. A controller
initialises, manages and updates these resources. This controller
keeps track of project configuration changes and applies them to
dependent resources as required.


*Shukra*: The kubernetes controller
-----------------------------------

The main intelligence and work of managing a Hasura project is done
by a special kind of service, typically referred to in the Kubernetes community
as a `controller <https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/controllers.md>`_ or
an `operator <https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html>`_.

*Shukra* is a service that connects to the kubernetes API server
and manages state, and other kubernetes resources that together represent the
Hasura platform. *Shukra* is not a web/API service; it is an
*active reconciliation process. It watches some object [project-configuration] for
the world's desired state, and it watches the world's actual state too.
Then, it sends instructions to try and make the world's current state be more like the desired state.*

*shukra* can be run with 2 arguments:

#. ``shukra -c controller-conf.json init``: *Shukra* initialises the platform state and exits
#. ``shukra -c controller-conf.json sync``: *Shukra* runs as an active process continuously syncing
   configuration changes to the kubernetes cluster. *sync* can only be run after a successful *init*.

.. note:: In sync mode, *shukra* runs as a kubernetes deployment. You
  can fetch information regarding shukra (eg: logs) by:

  ``kubectl -n hasura get deployment shukra``


Kubernetes lifecycle of a Hasura project
----------------------------------------

The easiest way to understand what a Hasura project looks like from the kubernetes
point of view is to understand how a Hasura project is initialised and how it
runs on a Kubernetes cluster.

1. A bare Kubernetes cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, we start off with a bare kubernetes cluster:

   :width: 50%

2. Adding the ``hasura`` namespace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Second, we create a hasura namespace where the Hasura platform
services will live:

.. image:: ../../img/2-hasura-ns.png
   :width: 50%

3. Specifying the initial configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Two important pieces of information are required to initialise a Hasura project:

#. Controller configuration: This specifies infrastructure level information
   for the Hasura controller (external IP, kubernetes API server
   information etc.)

#. Project configuration: This specifies the application level configuration
   (auth API configuration, domains/routes on the gateway etc.)

These are added as configmaps and secrets to the ``default`` namespace:

.. image:: ../../img/3-project-conf.png
   :height: 300px

4. Initialising the hasura platform state: controller *init*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To initialise the Hasura platform, some state needs to be initialised
(eg: create database schemas, create the superadmin user etc.)

The ``init`` command by the Hasura controller (codenamed: *shukra*)
does the following:

#. Initialises the postgres database server
#. Runs migrations for the hasura data, auth and filestore API services
#. Creates the superadmin user/password

The Hasura controller reports its progress and logs warnings/errors in
a configmap called ``hasura-project-status``.

This is what the kubernetes cluster would look like after a successful
``init``:

.. image:: ../../img/4-init.png

5. Deploying the hasura platform: controller *sync*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To deploy the Hasura platform, the controller deployment is created
and runs with the *sync* command.

The ``sync`` command by the Hasura controller does the following:

#. Watches the project-configuration (configmap & secret) for changes
#. Creates/updates kubernetes resources like deployments/services/configmaps according
   to those changes

The Hasura controller reports its progress and logs warnings/errors in
a configmap called ``hasura-project-status``.

This is what the kubernetes cluster would look like after a successful
``sync``:

.. image:: ../../img/5-sync.png

It is important to note, that the data, auth & filestore APIs depend on the
postgres server to initialise and maintain their state.
Additionally, the filestore API service also depends on a persistent-volume
to store its data (files).
