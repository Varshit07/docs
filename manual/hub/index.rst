/hub - How it works
===================

`hasura.io/hub <https://hasura.io/hub>`_ is a registry of hasura projects that you can use as a base
for your hasura project. These projects might help you get started with a bunch of microservices,
frameworks or schemas.

The ideal workflow is to start with a project that is closest to what you want to do, and then
modify that hasura project as you like, to build your own.

1. :doc:`Start with a project on hub <start-project>`
2. :doc:`Publish your project to hub <publish>`
