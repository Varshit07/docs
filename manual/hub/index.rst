Hasura Hub
==========

`hasura.io/hub <https://hasura.io/hub>`_ is a registry of hasura projects that you can use as a base
for your hasura project. These projects might help you get started with a bunch of microservices,
frameworks or schemas on which you can build on top of.

The ideal workflow is to start with a project that is closest to what you want to do, and then
modify that hasura project as you like, to build your own.
