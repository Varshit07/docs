Data
====

This section assumes that you have already created a project and know how to
launch your API console. If not, please head to :ref:`getting-started`.

The data APIs can be used to store and retrieve data. The actual data is stored
in Postgres tables. To fetch associated data, one can define relationships on
tables. Permissions can then be used to authorize the access to data based on
roles.
