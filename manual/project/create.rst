Creating a project
==================

The following will 'clone' the project `hasura/base <https://hasura.io/hub/project/hasura/base>`_ to your system from `hasura hub <https://hasura.io/hub>`_.

.. code:: bash

   $ hasura clone base my-project

      Cloning project...
      âœ“ Project cloned directory=<base-dir>/my-project

   # creates a directory called `my-project` and initializes an empty Hasura project


.. admonition:: Note

   You can clone any project from `hasura hub <https://hasura.io/hub>`_ and use that as a starting point for your new project.

   ``hasura/hello-world`` is a good starter project that contains a few database
   migrations, some sample data and even a sample microservice to learn about hasura quickly.

.. note::

  This command automatically initializes a git repository in your project folder
