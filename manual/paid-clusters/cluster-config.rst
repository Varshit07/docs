Managing cluster configuration
==============================

This section is applicable to Hasura's paid clusters or clusters setup on infrastructure not managed by Hasura like GKE, Azure, etc.
A cluster's initial configuration can be set by defining it in `clusters.yaml`. Subsequent changes to a cluster's configuration are also made in the same way - by modifying the config file and applying it to the cluster.

Let's take a look at all the use-cases for setting or modifying a cluster's configuration.
