====================================
Developing & hosting custom microservices
====================================

A Hasura project is composed of a set of microservices.
These include certain Hasura microservices like, ``postgres``, ``nginx``, ``data API``, ``auth API`` and more but can also
include your own microservices.

Some typical examples of microservices you would add to your application:

1. A custom API written in python-flask
2. A webapp that serves a UI written with the express framework in nodejs
3. A microservice that serves static files, for a simple HTML site, or a SPA in React or Angular
4. A ready made microservice like the ghost blog-engine
5. A 'stateful' microservice like a database

Hasura makes it easy for you to build and deploy custom microservices.

Here's what your Hasura cluster looks like before and after you add custom microservices:

These are the 3 key steps you need to follow for deploying any microservice:

1. Generate a microservice inside your project, using ``hasura generate
   microservice``. This will create a directory with the microservice name
   inside the ``microservice`` directory.  This will contain Kuberenetes specs
   for the microservice, optionally it can contain the source code and
   Dockerfile too.

2. Add a route (subdomain, or path) on which this microservice may be exposed
   to the external world.

3. Optionally, add it to the ``hasura`` remote, so that the microservice is
   deployed whenever you ``git push``.
