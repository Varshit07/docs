Hasura API explorer
===================

If you are using the Hasura APIs like Data, Auth, Filestore and Notify APIs,
use the API console to explore the Hasura APIs.

To open the API console, ``cd`` into the project directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ hasura api-console

This will open up a browser window at `http://localhost:9695 <http://localhost:9695>`_.

.. note::

  The API console also allows you to generate API client code. For eg: you can
  easily export a sample ``curl`` command for an API request you make from the
  API explorer.
